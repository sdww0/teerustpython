## [v0.7.0] - 2018-02-06
[v0.7.0]: https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0

### Added

#### UNIC Applications

UNIC Applications are binary creates hosting in the same repository as `unic`
super-crate, under the `apps/` directory. These creates are not internal parts
of the `unic` library, but tools designed and developed for the general
audience, also serving as a test bed for the UNIC API. We are starting with CLI
applications, and possibly expanding it to GUI and WEB applications, as well.

- `unic-cli` The new UNIC CLI application provides command-line tools for
  working with Unicode characters and strings. In this release, first versions
  of `unic-echo` and `unic-inspector` commands are implemented.

#### New Components

Character Property:

- `unic-ucd-common `: Common character properties (*alphabetic*, *alphanumeric*,
  *control*, *numeric*, and *white_space*).

- `unic-ucd-ident`: Unicode Identifier character properties.

- `unic-ucd-segment`: Unicode Segmentation character properties.

- `unic-emoji-char`: Unicode Emoji character properties.

String Algorithm:

- `unic-segment`: Implementation of Unicode Text Segmentation algorithms
  (*Grapheme Cluster* and *Word* boundaries).

### Misc

This release was delayed for a couple of cycles, because of the problems with
running tests in a workspace with a mix of std and no-std creates. The issue is
resolved as of `1.22.0`.

- Enable `no_std` for many of the existing components.

- Bumped Minimum Rust Version needed to `1.22.0`.

- Lots of small fixes for data types and internal structure updates.


## [v0.6.0] - 2017-09-22
[v0.6.0]: https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0

### Added

#### Abstractions for working with characters:

- `unic-char-range`: Range and iterator types for characters, plus a `chars!()`
  macro. (Used as `chars!('a'..'e')`, `chars!('a'..='e')`, or `chars!(..)`.)

- `unic-char-property`: New component based on the module previously in
  `unic-utils`, with new support for binary character properties.

#### Extending Unicode Character Database properties:

- `unic-ucd-name`: New minimal implementation of Unicode character names (*Name*
  property).

- `unic-ucd-case`: New basic implementation of Unicode character case
  properties.

- `unic-ucd-bidi`: Add `Bidi_Mirrored` and `Bidi_Control` properties.

### Removed

- Drop `unic-utils`'s `iter_all_chars()` in favor of `unic-char-range` types and
  macros.

### Misc

- All tables are now generated by the Rust pipeline! ðŸŽ‰

- The Rust table generation has been cleaned up to a very nice level of polish! âœ¨

- `unic-utils`: Restructure tables into a dedicated type, rather than a mix of
  traits and "blessed" std types.


## [v0.5.0] - 2017-08-05
[v0.5.0]: https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0

### Added

- `unic-ucd-category`: Support *General_Category* Unicode (UCD) character
  property, implemented as `enum GeneralCategory`.

- `unic-ucd-nomal`: Support *Decomposition_Type* Unicode (UCD) character
  property, implemented as `enum DecompositionType`.

### Changed

- `unic-ucd-normal`: Update *Canonical_Combining_Class* implementation to *tuple
  struct* and add update API accordingly.

- `unic-ucd-age`: Update *Age* property implementation to not cause API breakage
  on new Unicode versions.

- `unic-utils`: Rename from `unic-ucd-utils`, to contain all data-less utility
  functionalities.
  [[GH-50](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/50)]

- Expand character property API in implementations, in the process of defining
  trait-based contracts for all (UCD and other) character properties.
  [[GH-66](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/66)]
  [[GH-34](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/34)]

- Reorganize code structure to make room for dev packages, like new `unic-gen`
  crateâ€”which is going to replace the Python implementation for data table
  generation.

- `unic-ucd`: Expand cross-component and conformance tests.
  [[GH-18](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/18)]
  [[GH-43](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/43)]

### Removed

- Drop data-dependent integration tests from packaging, allowing all tests pass
  for downloaded packages.
  [[GH-34](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/34)]

- Drop dependency on `rustc_test` in favor of default integration test harness.
  [[GH-76](https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/issues/76)]


## [v0.4.0] - 2017-06-23
[v0.4.0]: https://github.com/open-i18n/rust-unic/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0

### Added

- `UnicodeVersion` type, and use in all components for `UNICODE_VERSION`, and
  allow conversion to/from `Age` character property.

### Changed

- `unic-ucd`: Create common API for UCD character properties (`Prop::of(ch: char)`).

- `unic-idna`: Use standard `binary_search_by()`.

- Split IDNA Mapping data into `unic-idna-mapping` and leave the process
  algorithms in `unic-idna`.

- Pass in `bench_it` feature to components supporting it.
  (Only `unic-bidi` at the moment.)
