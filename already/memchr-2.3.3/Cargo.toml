# # The 'std' feature permits the memchr crate to use the standard library. This
# # permits this crate to use runtime CPU feature detection to automatically
# # accelerate searching via vector instructions. Without the standard library,
# # this automatic detection is not possible.
# std = []
# # The 'use_std' feature is DEPRECATED. It will be removed in memchr 3. Until
# # then, it is alias for the 'std' feature.
