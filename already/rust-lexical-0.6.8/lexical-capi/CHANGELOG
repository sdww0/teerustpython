## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.7] 2020-01-27
### Changed
- Changed number_format to use 64-bit flags, which required changing enum in the C-API to macros.
- Added `no_integer_leading_zeros` and `no_float_leading_zeros` number_format flags.
- Added `invalid_leading_zeros` to error_code enum.

## [0.6.6] 2020-01-26
### Changed
- Updated the format bitflags to make matches more efficient, allowing jumptables to be used for most situations.

## [0.6.4] 2020-01-23
### Added
- Added `format` feature to control parsing integers and floats from number specifications.
- Added the `NumberFormat` bitflags to control Number format specifications. These flags control how a number is parsed, including enabling the use of digit separators, requiring integer or fraction digits, and more.
- Added more values to `ErrorCode` to signify more parse failures.

### Changed
- Changed `ErrorCode::MissingFraction` to be `ErrorCode::MissingMantissa`, to differentiate between missing integers, missing fractions, and missing significant digits (mantissa).

## [0.6.0] - 2019-09-08
### Added
- Created repository, and added all Python, C++, and C bindings.
