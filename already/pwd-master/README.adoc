This is a small veneer over pwd.h, mostly just hides away the `unsafe` parts.

== Installation

In the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`, add the following line:

[source="rust"]
----
[dependencies]
pwd = "1"
----

== Usage

In your crate root, add:

[source="rust"]
----
extern crate pwd;
----

=== Example

[source="rust"]
----
extern crate pwd;

use pwd::Passwd;

fn main() {
    let me = Passwd::current_user();
    println!("my username is {}, home directory is {}, and my shell is {}. My uid/gid are {}/{}",
             me.name, me.dir, me.shell, me.uid, me.gid);
}
