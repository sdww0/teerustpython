This UNIC component implements algorithms from [Unicode® Standard Annex #9 -
Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/), a.k.a.
*UBA*, used for display of mixed right-to-left and left-to-right text.  It is
written in safe Rust, compatible with the current stable release.

## Notes

Initial code for this component is based on
[`unicode-bidi`](https://github.com/servo/unicode-bidi).
