# Fuzzing harnesses

This is intended for integration fuzzing and those decoders that do not yet
live in their own crate. `image-png` for example has their own fuzzing targets.

## Using the fuzzer

> $ cargo install afl
> $ RUSTFLAGS="-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=gold" cargo +nightly afl build --release --bin fuzzer_script_<format>
> $ cargo afl fuzz -i ./in/<format> -o ./out/<format> ./target/release/fuzzer_script_<format>
